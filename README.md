## General info

#### Polygons:

The first step was to create a grid of polygons. We did that by generating random points which created Voronoi polygons. Then we replaced each point by the centroid of the polygon region related to this point.

The polygons weren't evenly distributed, so we used a technique called *Lloyd relaxation*, which replaces each point by the centroid of this polygon. <br>
Here we also plotted edges to the neighbouring polygons.

#### Map representation

Map is built from two graphs, *Nodes* and *Edges*.
*Nodes* graph has edges between every neighbouring polygons. *Edges* graph has edges between every neighbouring corners.

<details><summary>Terrain types:</summary>
<p>

```python
class TerrainType(Enum):
    OCEAN = 1
    LAND = 2
    LAKE = 3
    COAST = 4
```
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>class Graph:</summary>
<p>

```python
class Graph:
    Centers
	Corners
	Edges
```
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>class Center:</summary>
<p>

```python
class Center:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.neighbors = []
        self.borders = []
        self.corners = []
        self.terrain_type = TerrainType.LAND
        self.biome = BiomeType.OCEAN
        self.height = 0
        self.moisture = 0
```
* `Center.neighbors` is a set of adjacent polygons
* `Center.borders` is a set of bordering edges
* `Center.corners` is a set of polygon corners
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>class Corner:</summary>
<p>

```python
class Corner:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.touches = []
        self.protrudes = []
        self.adjacent = []
        self.terrain_type = TerrainType.LAND
        self.height = 0
        self.downslope = None
        self.river = 0
        self.moisture = 0
```

* `Corner.touches` is a set of polygons touching this corner
* `Corner.protrudes` is a set of edges touching the corner
* `Corner.adjacent` is a set of corners connected to this one

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>class Edge:</summary>
<p>

```python
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, center1, center2, corner1, corner2):
        self.d0 = center1
        self.d1 = center2
        self.v0 = corner1
        self.v1 = corner2
        self.river = 0
```

* `Edge.d0` and `Edge.d1` are the polygons connected by the Delaunay edge
* `Edge.v0` and `Edge.v1` are the corners connected by the Voronoi edge

</p>

#### Islands

#### Elevation

First we set the elevation to be the distance from the coast.

TODO (SWi) write about redistribution

Elevation is very important for:
* Biomes types:
	* high elevations: get snow, rock, tundra
	* medium elevations: get shrubs, deserts, forests, and grassland
	* low elevations: get rain forests, grassland, and beaches
* Rivers flow from high elevations down to the coast. Having elevations that always increase away from the coast means that thereâ€™s no local minima that complicate river generation.

#### Rivers

First we defined *downslope*. From each *Corner* it is an arrow that points towards its lowest neighbouring corner.

We say that rivers flow from the highest points downwards following the *downslopes*.

We chose a random point in the mountains and we follow *downslopes* until we reach a lake or the ocean.

If more than one river is flowing through a given edge the river becomes visually thicker. The formula for width of an edge with *k* rivers is:

```python
river_width(k) = 2 + 2 * sqrt(k)
```
